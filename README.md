**Objective:**
==============
Conducted a comprehensive analysis of accident data to predict accident severity based on factors such as weather conditions, road types, and vehicle involvement.

**Key Contributions:**
====================
Addressed data imbalance challenges by experimenting with techniques like oversampling, undersampling, and class-weight adjustments.
Preprocessed data and engineered features, such as accident frequency by road type and severity trends over time, to improve model inputs.
Implemented and evaluated machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost and SVM, to identify key accident predictors.
Designed Excel dashboards to present data insights and visualize accident trends, enhancing data storytelling.
Challenges and Outcomes:
Faced difficulty in achieving high accuracy due to the dataset's imbalanced nature but gained valuable experience in handling real-world datasets.
Developed a deeper understanding of imbalanced data techniques, paving the way for more effective solutions in future projects.
